           <br><br> <h2 class="aboutMe">A little about myself:</h2>
            <p class="contents" style="text-indent: 40px"> I'm a jack of all trades, master of like one or two. I was originally forged in the hectic fires of the restaurant industry where I thrived as a self-taught chef, and later transitioned into an insurance agent as a means to eacape the draining lifestyle proliferated by the former. Having realized that being an insurance agent wasn't as fulfilling as I'd hoped, I decided to give being a web developer a shot. Life is too short to forgo calculated risks in lieu of any lifestyle other than what I've dreamed up as ideal.</p>

            <h3 class="skillsInterests">Skills & Interests:</h3>
            <p class="contents" style="text-indent: 40px">My interests are a wide-cast net that may strike some as atypical of the average suburban normie that I embody at face-value. Writing was my first love, and I've amassed a decent collection of written works including hundreds of poems and several stories, along with nonfiction essays and editorials. Music came next as I learned guitar as a young boy and later picked up piano, violin, drums, and vocals. While I've never surpassed amateur status, I have a deep appreciation for the art of creating music in any form.Finally,I spend a great deal of time deeping my knowledge of culinary arts and technique; never missing a chance to cook a new and challenging dish in a never-ending pursiut of consistent perfeciton. My time in the restaurant industry was what helped me cultivate this passion, further bolstered by the internet's unfathomable wealth of knowledge.</p>
            <h3 class="skillsInterests">Career Goals:</h3>
            <p class="contents" style="text-indent: 40px">I've worn many hats in my short time on this earth, having at many points called myself a chef, a plumber, a bartender, an insurance agent, among other things. After my time at Devmountain, I hope to achieve certain perameters I've yet to meet in my previous lives:
            <ul class="bullets">- Sustainable Salary</ul>
            <ul class="bullets">- Remote Flexibility</ul>
            <ul class="bullets">- Benefits</ul></p><br><br>
